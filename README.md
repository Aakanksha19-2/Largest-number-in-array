# Largest-number-in-array
The basic array problem.
In this problem I tried to find out the largest number in the given array.

for example:
arr[] = {10,6,5,3,7}     // this is a given array
n = 5                    // size of the given array
Then our output should be 10.

I have uploaded the short code!(my first quick code)ðŸ˜‚
